Code compiles and runs fine. The directory structure is a bit off from what it should be and you don't have the
test code that I provided you, so I'm not certain what you did with this repository when you built it. There are also
some usability issues. The main thing is that you have items with horrible names and I have to type the whole name
with proper capitalization in order to manipulate them. The names are fine, but you might want to convert things to
lowercase and use contains when you check for what item they are getting.

Code compiles, but it doesn't run. The directory structure is still off. We need to fix that. Perhaps you should come by
office hours so we can work on that. Related to that, I get an exception when I run this because the map file isn't
found. There is still a lot of code missing from having this fully work with actors as well.

You have a class for a heap, but it isn't fully implemented to the point where you can use it with the activity manager.
