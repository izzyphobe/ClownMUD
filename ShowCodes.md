## Show Code #3 on 2/19 (4 of 4 points)

Code compiles and runs fine. The directory structure is a bit off from what it should be and you don't have the
test code that I provided you, so I'm not certain what you did with this repository when you built it. There are also
some usability issues. The main thing is that you have items with horrible names and I have to type the whole name
with proper capitalization in order to manipulate them. The names are fine, but you might want to convert things to
lowercase and use contains when you check for what item they are getting.
