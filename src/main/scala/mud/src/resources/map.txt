Computer Lab
Millions of computers are lined up. Millions. Clown college has gotten more and more popular since the most recent mass extinction event.

Crumpled up gum wrapper
Smells like juicy fruit. Mmmm...
Floppy disk
Who put this here? Was this someone's idea of a joke? This may be clown college, but that is NOT funny.
A copy of E.T. for the Atari 2600
Based on the film of the same name. Released in 1982 never to be seen again.

Darkened Hallway
A faint droning can be heard. It sounded like it was miles away, but as soon as you stepped foot in the hallway, it seemed to be right by your ear.

Whoopie cushion
Someone wrote 'TURN ME OVER' in blood on it. You turn it over. The other side says 'GOTCHA', also written in blood. Classy.

Bathroom
The stalls are arranged in a circle. In the center, there are ten sinks, each a different color of the rainbow. Carousel music is playing. After a few seconds, you realize the whole thing is spinning.

Biology lab
The stench of Clown Biology majors fills the air. These clowns are clownier than you'll ever be. You start to wonder if you'll really fit in here.

Clown skeleton
You didn't realize clown skeletons looked different than human ones. Apparently they do.
Educational Poster
It says "CLOWN REPRODUCTION" in huge letters. The diagram depicts the trajectory of a pie being hurled at a clown.

Jester's Courtyard
It's cold outside. It makes your clown makeup itch a lot. This must be the main outside area - clowns are walking and running and hand-walking and hand-running and headstanding and juggling and brandishing pies everywhere. You realize this might be the right place for you after all.

Banjo
Someone left their banjo. It looks expensive.
Custard Pie
A classic.

Clown Containment Units - 1st Floor
You enter the first floor of the student housing. Each dorm room door is a different color of the rainbow. You're on the third floor - room 323b.

Cookie
Oatmeal raisin. Hmm... That's the least silly cookie out there! This has no business being at clown college. You might turn this in to security - the perp could be suspended.

Clown Containment Units - 3rd Floor
You take the elevator up. These doors... They're metal, and spaced only one foot apart. This isn't right... This isn't right at all...

Piece of broken glass
There's some custard on it. Something horrible has happened.

Your dorm
It's approximately 5 feet in width, and goes 10 feet deep. Not huge, but at least you're in a single!
